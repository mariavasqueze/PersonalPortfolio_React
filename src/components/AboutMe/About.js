          I have a background in Business and Marketing, but decided to go full
          time into software development because it's my passion. I moved to
          Canada from Colombia ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡´ and studied to be a full stack developer. I
          work everyday with React and Next.js in Javascript and Typescript
          working on UI and functionality. Please check out more of my skills
          below.
